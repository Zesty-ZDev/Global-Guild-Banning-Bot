## FAQ

#### Why can anyone use the ban command?

The ban command has a default permission to ban members users normally this applies to all servers the bot is in because of this we strongly advise disabling "Public Bot" on the discord developer portal

#### Why are random users being banned from my guilds?

The bot allows anyone that can ban users in the guild they are executing the command in this applys to specificly their own guilds as they would most likely be able to ban members from their own guild a simple solution this issue would be to disable "Public Bot" on the discord developer portal if however the bot is not public is is most likely that an admin in one of your servers in abusing the command to check who is using the command check audit logs and the bot wil say which admin bans them after the ban reason

#### Why am I getting a DisallowedIntents error?

The Bot requires the "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" enabled in the discord developer portal. To do this head to the developer portal and select your application then select bot and scroll down to enable and disabled intents at this time however the bot only needs the "SERVER MEMBERS INTENT" enabled
